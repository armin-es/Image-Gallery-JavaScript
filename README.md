# image-gallery-javaScript-1
## Basic image gallery using JavaScript

This project is based on the first peer reviewed assignment of the [Interactivity with JavaScript](https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript) course given by the University of Michigan at Coursera.

The project involves writing JavaScript code to create a small image gallery with the following features:

* Large image is displayed when the mouse pointer hovers over a preview image,
* Default background reappears when the mouse pointer leaves the preview image.
